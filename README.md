How To Work With Scripts:  
Download CommentsCount.py and edit lines 7-8 to change the path of "RawMoodleLog.csv" and "UsersWithID.csv"  
run CommentsCount.py and look at AllStudentsCommentsStatus.csv for results.  
  
Download ViewsCount.py and edit lines 7-8 to change the path of "RawMoodleLog.csv" and "UsersWithID.csv"  
run ViewsCount.py and look at AllStudentsViewsStatus.csv for results.  

after you have AllStudentsCommentsStatus.csv and AllStudentsViewsStatus.csv, view they appear ok, upload them to google drive and share with your class.  

I might add in the future scripts to automatically update the google sheets as well.
